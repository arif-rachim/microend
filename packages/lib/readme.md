# Microend Library

Microend Library is a repository for web components that serve as the fundamental building blocks for microend
applications. This library includes the following items:

1. MicroEndRouter is a web component that performs the functions of routing and rendering modules based on the user
   input in the url address bar or when one module calls another module using the navigateTo function.
2. MicroEndModuleLoader is a web component that has the capability of installing modules into user's device. The module
   loader will check to see if the module you want to install already satisfies the requirements that must be met before
   a module can actually be installed.
3. The MicroEndPackageManager is a web component that has the capability to display information from modules that have
   been installed on the device as well as view information from a module in greater detail.
