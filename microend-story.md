To protect my current employment, I'm posting this anonymously:

After graduating from college in 2004, I immediately began a career as a software developer. Since programming knowledge doesn't tend to last very long, I'm constantly learning new things and updating what I know.

Based on what I've learned from my past mistakes, here are some pieces of advice I'd give my younger self.

I know you're excited to put your newly-implemented J2EE 3 tier into production, but keep in mind that modern applications go much deeper than the presentation layer.
In the future, RWAs, or Rich Web - based applications, will become the norm. You also need a firm grasp of Front-End development practices if you want to create Rich Web Apps.
Websites' front end will be built in a web browser. Choosing a framework will put you in a difficult position. Keep in mind, though, that it's best to take a modular approach when creating a Front-End. Guarantee that your front-end component can be used with any framework. Make a system for the front-end modules to talk to each other.

We are aware that front-end technology is transitory. A java applet used to exist that allowed for the creation of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) applications. Then came tools like Microsoft Silverlight and Adobe Flex, which allowed developers to make dynamic, user-friendly websites. Then, the front-end developer began using jquery and other forms of HTML. Then Chrome advanced browser technology, and new javascript frameworks, such as the Java Web Toolkit, were developed (bridging java developer to the web). First there was Angular, then React, and now we have a native web component that can be used in any browser today.

If you've worked in software development for any length of time, you'll be familiar with this loop.

However, it cannot be denied that a technological revival is necessary. At times, we need to start over technologically because of what has happened. For instance, Java applets have fallen out of favor because they increase download times and are difficult to convince users to download (3 billion devices running on Java). The death of Adobe Flex could also be a result of Apple's decision to stop supporting Flash. Or, in the case of libraries like jQuery, browser support that is redundant. It might be a framework like angular, which is losing favor with programmers every year. In addition, React's reign as the industry standard is uncertain.

Although technological advancement is inevitable, many businesses have already invested millions into ERP systems that are based on outdated systems. After all this time and effort, are we just going to start over every time the technology becomes obsolete? The dangers of starting over with a blank slate have been weighed, such as making sure the new app's features are at least on par with the old one.

Lucky for me, I'm a part of the third wave of my company's technology regeneration effort. Having learned this, I now realize that I could have saved the company millions of dollars if I had previously developed software using a modular approach on the front end. Because of this, it's crucial to build applications out of separate modules, each of which can function independently. This realization led me to develop the concept of the "microend," which is a modular approach to the front end of software.
